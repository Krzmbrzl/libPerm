# Examples

This directory contains examples of how the different components of `libPerm` can be used.

In order to build the examples, pass `-DLIBPERM_EXAMPLES=ON` when invoking cmake for building `libPerm`. The executables can then be found in your
build directory (inside the `bin` subdirectory).

The examples mostly cover only basic usage that is supposed to represent the most common use-cases. If you require a more in-depth view about how the
individual components work together, have a look at the actual documentation.
