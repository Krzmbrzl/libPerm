# libPerm

A C++17 library for representing and handling of permutation groups.

This library has been heavily inspired by https://github.com/tremlin/PermLib (which seems to aim at solving essentially the same problem but targeting
an older C++ standard and additionally uses a different philosophy on how where to use dynamic memory allocations. Plus the project seems to be
unmaintained at this point). Additionally the following literature has been used as references (probably incomplete):
- T. Rehn, "Fundamental Permutation Group Algorithms For Symmetry Computation", Diploma thesis, Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg (2010)
- L. R. U. Manssur et al., "Group-theoretic approach for symbolic tensor manipulation", _Int. J. Mod. Phys. C_, 13, **7**, 859-879 (DOI: 10.1142/S0129183102004571)
